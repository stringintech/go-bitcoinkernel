A Go wrapper for Bitcoin Core's [`libbitcoinkernel`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30595) library.

## ⚠️ Work in Progress

This library is experimental and not production-ready. The underlying C API is subject to change, which may cause breaking changes in this wrapper. The wrapper itself may also change based on user feedback, which is welcome and appreciated. Feel free to open issues to help make this wrapper more useful for everyone.

## Overview

This repository consists of:

- **Bitcoin Core Source**: [Git subtree](./depend/bitcoin) containing Bitcoin Core source code with `libbitcoinkernel` C
  API
- **Kernel Package**: Safe, idiomatic Go interfaces with integrated CGO bindings that manage memory and provide error handling
- **Utils Package**: Helper functions and utilities built on the kernel package wrappers for common operations

## Installation and Usage

Since this library includes native C++ dependencies that must be compiled from source, it cannot be installed directly
via `go get` (at least for now). Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stringintech/go-bitcoinkernel.git
cd go-bitcoinkernel
```

### Step 2: Build the Native Library

```bash
make build-kernel
```

This command will configure Bitcoin Core's CMake build system and build only the `libbitcoinkernel` shared library. Refer to Bitcoin Core's build documentation to for the minimum requirements to compile `libbitcoinkernel` from source:
([Unix](./depend/bitcoin/doc/build-unix.md),
[macOS](./depend/bitcoin/doc/build-osx.md),
[Windows](./depend/bitcoin/doc/build-windows.md))

### Step 3: Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

This ensures that both the native library and Go bindings are working correctly.

The tests also include examples demonstrating how to use different components. For example, see:
- [`chainstate_manager_test.go`](./kernel/chainstate_manager_test.go)
- [`logger_test.go`](./utils/logger_test.go)

### Step 4: Use in Your Project

In your Go project directory, add a replace directive to point to your local copy:

```bash
# Initialize your Go module (if not already done)
go mod init your-project-name

# Add replace directive to use local go-bitcoinkernel
go mod edit -replace github.com/stringintech/go-bitcoinkernel=/path/to/go-bitcoinkernel

# Add the dependency
go get github.com/stringintech/go-bitcoinkernel/kernel
```

Your `go.mod` file should look like this:

```go
module your-project-name

go 1.23.3

require github.com/stringintech/go-bitcoinkernel/kernel v0.0.0-00010101000000-000000000000

replace github.com/stringintech/go-bitcoinkernel => /path/to/go-bitcoinkernel
```

## Important Notes

### Memory Management

The library handles memory management automatically through Go's finalizers (see [common.go](./kernel/common.go)), but it's highly recommended to explicitly
call `Destroy()` methods when you're done with owned objects to free resources immediately.

### Error Handling

The library uses structured error types for better error handling (see [errors.go](./kernel/errors.go)).

### Runtime Dependencies

Your Go application will have a runtime dependency on the shared `libbitcoinkernel` library produced by `make build-kernel` in `/path/to/go-bitcoinkernel/depend/bitcoin/build`. Do not delete or move these built library files as your application needs them to run.
